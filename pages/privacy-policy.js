              <h4>2. What is Personal Information</h4>
              <p>Personal information is any information which we collect about you that can be used to identify you and includes any information, such as your name, address, email and IP address. It also includes any personal information that we may collect about you that is in the public domain, such as information made public on social media that is available to us when you connect with us on social media.</p>
              <p>It is our intention to provide you with as much information as possible about what we do with that personal information, so that when you provide the personal information to us, you do so with an awareness of how it will be used.</p>
              <h4>3. Our Privacy Statement</h4>
              <p>The protection of your privacy while we process your personal information is a very important concern to us. We have legal obligations to you about how we handle your personal information and keeping you informed about such use. We take our responsibility to do this very seriously. Any personal information collected by us about or during your visits to our Website (or otherwise) is processed by us according our legal obligations and our own privacy standards.</p>
              <p>It is important that you read this Privacy Notice together with any other privacy policy or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This Privacy Notice supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.</p>
              <h4>4. How we collect your personal information and why</h4>

              <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

              </ul>
              <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal justification for processing your personal data although we will get your consent before sending direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>We recommend that you read their privacy notices and contact them directly if you have any concerns regarding their use of your personal information.</p>
              <h5>Contacting us</h5>
              <p>Our Website provides you with different ways to contact us, including by telephone, post or through the Website messaging form. All communications are handled, reviewed and responded to internally by us.</p>
              <p>Please note, however, that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We use an email monitoring or blocking software and that you have a responsibility to ensure that any email you send to us is within the bounds of the law;</li>
                <li>We use telecoms service provider, BT, for our main call system, which provides caller ID services, we will only use this information in our legitimate interests for the purposes of handling your call and contacting you in relation to the purpose of your call.</li>
                <li>As part of communicating with us, we will collect personal information about you that we require in our legitimate interest to deal with your enquiry.

              <h4>5.Your data and third parties</h4>
              <p>We do use third parties to provide services to us from time to time; therefore, we will need to share data with them that it is in our legitimate interests for business administrative needs. We have explained throughout this Privacy Notice which categories of processors we use for different collection purposes. Section 7 below also explains certain circumstances in which we may need to share your personal information.<p>
              <h4>6. Transferring data outside of the European Economic Area</h4>
              <p>Certain of our external third parties are based outside the UK and the European Economic Area and so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. When personal data is transferred to countries outside of the UK and the EEA those countries may not offer an equivalent level of protection for personal data to the laws in the UK. Where this is the case we will ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
                <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK and the EEA.</p>
              <h4>7. Disclosure of personal information</h4>
              <p>We will not usually disclose your personal information other than as already explained in Sections 4, 5, and 6 above. However, there may be circumstances where we need to share personal information other than as anticipated in Sections 4,  5 and 6 above. These include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>where we are legally required to disclose the information. This includes sharing the personal information with tax authorities and law enforcement agencies for the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime;</li>
                <li>where we need to disclose the personal information for the purpose of or in connection with any legal proceedings, or for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, or the disclosure is otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal rights;</li>
                <li>disclosure is required to protect the our interests, or someone else’s interests (for example, to prevent fraud);</li>
                <li>it is to a third party for the purposes of providing administrative or processing services on our behalf. If such disclosure is required we will take steps to ensure that the third party protects the personal information in the same way that we do and notify you of any changes to this Privacy Notice; and</li>
                <li>to any prospective purchaser of our business assets or organisation.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>8. Keeping personal information secure and data retention</h4>
              <p>We know that you provide your personal information in good faith and expect it to be looked after. This is why we take the security of your personal information seriously. This means that we have taken steps internally in order to ensure that our systems adequately protect your personal information. This includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>taking reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information;</li>
                <li>storing all the personal information you provide on our secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers;</li>
                <li>protecting all electronic transactions entered into via our Website by 128bit encryption technology.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Please be aware that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</strong></p>
              <p>You are responsible for keeping your password and other login details confidential. We will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to our Website).</p>
              <p>We have set out specific retention periods for your personal information throughout in respect of certain of our processing, but generally speaking we will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this notice. In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting  requirements.</p>
              <p>In specific circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.</p>
