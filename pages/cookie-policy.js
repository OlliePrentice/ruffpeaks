                <h4>2. What cookies we use and why.</h4>
                <p>We use several different types of cookies. In particular, we use: strictly necessary cookies which enable certain fundamental website features; analytical/ performance cookies which monitor usage of our Website, functionality cookies which allow us to remember choices you make (e.g. your cookie preference); and targeting cookies, which record your visit to our Website and allow us to present advertising and special offers to you which are relevant to you interests. Some of these are session cookies which are temporary and allow us to link your actions during a single visit to our site, and which are erased when you close your browser. Others are persistent cookies which remain on your device for the period of time specified in the cookie.</p>
                <p>The following is a more detailed explanation of the types of cookies we use, categorised by the purpose of the cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strictly necessary cookies: these are cookies that are essential for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services</li>
                    <li>Analytical/performance cookies: these cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These are used to improve our Website and information we collect from these cookies are done so anonymously. These cookies are also used to compile visitor statistics (called analytics) such as how many people have visited our Website, what type of technology you are using (e.g. Mac or Windows, which helps to identify when our Website isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long you spend on the Website, what pages they look at, etc. This helps us to continuously improve our Website. These so called “analytics” programs work on an anonymous basis and as such don’t hold any personally identifiable information.</li>
                    <li>Functionality cookies: these are used to recognise you when you come back to our Website so that we can personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences.</li>
                    <li>Targeting cookies: these cookies record your visit to our Website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Website and the advertising and special offers displayed both on this Website and other Website that you visit more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Examples of the cookies that we use</h4>
                <p><i>Google Analytics</i></p>
                <p>Whenever you visit our Website we will use a third party service, Google Analytics, on our behalf and for our legitimate interests, to collect standard information about your website use, for analytical and performance purposes, such as internet logs and details of your visitor behaviour patterns. The reason we use this service is so that we have information that helps us to find out how our Website is working and how to improve it. We do not identify anyone, and we do not make or allow Google Analytics to (or attempt to) identify anyone visiting our Website.</p>
                <p><i>Facebook Pixel</i></p>
                <p>We use Facebook Pixel on our Website. Facebook Pixel is a tracking code which allows us to track and monitor the success of advertisements we use on Facebook and to improve the effectiveness of those advertisements by recording information such as the device you used to access our Website and the actions you took on our Website using cookies. We may also use Facebook Pixel to create retargeting advertisements and custom audiences for our advertisements on Facebook and on our Website.</p>
                <p>Facebook aggregates data gathered from our use of Facebook Pixel on our Website with data it gathers from other sources, in order to improve and target advertisements displayed on its website or via its services, to improve its systems and to provide measurement services to third parties which use Facebook’s advertising services. You can find out more about how Facebook handles information they collect about you and other individuals by accessing their privacy policy, which is available here: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.</p>
                <p><i>Other third party cookies</i></p>
                <p>Our Website, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded Vimeo video. Our Website includes the following which use cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>home, basket, account and checkout pages</li>
                    <li>other embedded content.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These third parties control the cookies they use and any information collected by viewing their content. Disabling these cookies will likely break some of the functions offered by these third partie</p>
                <h4>What you can do if you do not consent to the use of cookies</h4>
                <p>Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our Website you can block cookies at any time by activating the settings on your browser that allows you to refuse all or some cookies. We explain how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that parts of our Website will not work as you would expect, for example you will no longer be able to use the Website to purchase goods and services online.</p>
                <p><i>We therefore would rather you did not block cookies when using our Website.</i></p>
                <p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. Alternatively you can visit <a href='http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban'>http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban</a> or <a href='https://allaboutcookies.org'>allaboutcookies.org</a> which provides general information about cookies and how you can manage cookies on your computer.</p>
                <p>To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit: <a href='http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout'>http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</a></p>
                <p>Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of our and a large proportion of the world’s websites, as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.</p>
                <p>It may be that if you have concerns around cookies they in fact relate to so called “spyware”. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.</p>
